## 0.2.0 Submission

This is a minor release to fix the error on CRAN's Solaris build, and add a few new features.

## 0.1.0 Submission

This is the first release of clock. There are no references that I would like to include with the package. The installed size of clock may be large on some platforms due to the large amount of templated C++ code included with the package.
