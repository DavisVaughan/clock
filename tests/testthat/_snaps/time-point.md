# cannot floor to more precise precision

    Can't floor to a more precise precision.

# rounding with `origin` requires same clock

    Can't convert `origin` <time_point<sys><day>> to <time_point<naive><day>>.

# `origin` can be cast to a more precise `precision`, but not to a less precise one

    Can't convert `origin` <time_point<naive><millisecond>> to <time_point<naive><hour>>.
    Can't cast to a less precise precision.

# `origin` must be size 1

    `origin` must have length 1.

# `origin` must not be `NA`

    `origin` must not be `NA`.

# `origin` can't be Date or POSIXt

    Can't convert `origin` <date> to <time_point<naive><day>>.
